        <p>I am a licensed clinical social worker and psychotherapist in private practice in Randolph, N.J. I have 30+ years of experience helping people deal with and grow beyond troubling personal issues. I have substantial post-graduate training which fosters in-depth work, but I also see people for short term therapy.</p>

        <p>I work with individual adults and couples who come in for many reasons including depression, anxiety, self esteem, or relationship issues such as affairs, communication problems, intimacy issues, problems with children of all ages, problems with parents and with extended families. I also work with chronically ill and terminally ill people and family members.</p>

        <p>Are you having trouble with difficult people in your life? We can look at new strategies for dealing with them. You may be amazed at how you can change the dynamic between yourself. and others, even difficult others.</p>

        <p>Most people first seek treatment when their situation has become intolerable. Some, who have had a positive experience with prior treatment, know how helpful therapy can be and don’t wait for an extreme circumstance to get started.</p>

        <p>You may be apprehensive about beginning therapy, but you’ll most likely find our first meeting a positive experience in which you feel understood and listened to. You’ll leave with an overview of our initial objectives and how we’ll approach the work that we’ll do together.</p>

        <p>My Randolph office is within a 15-minute drive from Succasunna, Denville, Rockaway, Morris Plains, Cedar Knolls, Morristown, Mendham, Chester, Mine Hill, Kenvil, Mount Arlington, and Roxbury.</p>

        <p>I have been doing telehealth on a HIPAA compliant platform since March 2020. Virtual sessions are secure, private and effective. In-person sessions will resume once Covid-19 pandemic is completely gone.</p>
